\title{Abbreviate genus name}
\usage{
abbrevGen(tiplabels = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tiplabels}{A vector of genus names or tip labels to be abbreviated.}

\item{abbrevfull}{A logical value indicating whether to fully abbreviate genus
names, if set to \code{TRUE}. If all genera have different initial letters,
abbreviations will be until the first letter. If at least two different genera
are similar in the first letter, then all genera will be abbreviated until the
second letter.  If at least two different genera  are similar in the first two
letters, then all genera will be abbreviated until the third letter.}

\item{abbrevmult}{A logical value indicating whether to fully abbreviate genus
names in different ways depending on how they differ to each other based on
the initial letters. If set to \code{TRUE}, in cases where multiple genera
share similarities in their first, second, and third letters, the function
will generate an abbreviation, extending up to the fourth letter for
disambiguation.}
}
\value{
A dataframe.

\description{
