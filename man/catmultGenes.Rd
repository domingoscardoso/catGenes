\title{Compares gene datasets for combined phylogenetic analysis when species are
duplicated or represented by multiple accessions in one DNA alignment}
\usage{
catmultGenes(\dots,
             maxspp = TRUE,
             shortaxlabel = TRUE,
             missdata = TRUE,
             outgroup = NULL,
             verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{a list of NEXUS-formatted gene datasets as read by ape's \code{\link{read.nexus.data}}
or at least two individually ape-read objects of NEXUS-formatted gene datasets.}

\item{maxspp}{Logical, if \code{FALSE} any species never duplicated with
multiple accessions in any indvidual DNA alignment might end either duplicated
or deleted, depending on the chosen missdata argument. We recomend to maxspp =
\code{TRUE} so as to maximize the taxon coverage. This means that if the species
is not duplicated in any individual dataset, it will always be kept in the final
concatenated dataset no matter each sequence for that species across the individual
dataset were generated from distinct collections or accessions.}

\item{shortaxlabel}{Logical, if \code{FALSE} the final individual gene dataset will maintain
the accession numbers associated with each species or sequence.}

\item{missdata}{Logical, if \code{FALSE} the comparison will exclude any species
that lacks a complete sequence for one of the input gene dataset.}

\item{outgroup}{Provide the outgroup taxa (either one taxon name or a vector of
multiple taxon names that are present in all individual gene dataset) if the
concatenation is intended to maintain incomplete taxa (taxa missing the sequence for a particular gene).}

\item{verbose}{Logical, if \code{FALSE}, a message showing each step during
gene matching search will not be printed in the console in full.}
}
\value{
A list of dataframes of the equally-sized gene dataset, where the first column "species"
include all taxon names and the second column "sequence" include the DNA sequence for the corresponding taxon.
}
\description{
Compares a list of "n" gene datasets (individual DNA alignments)
and makes them with the same number of taxa, ready for combined, multigene
phylogenetic analysis. This function is best designed for concatenating DNA
alignments where species have duplicated sequences (multiple accessions) from
different collections. Then, make sure the species are labeled with both the
scientific name and the same identifying number throughout each DNA alignment.
Identifying numbers could be collector surname and associated collection number,
or an accession number for the isolated DNA from which each gene was sequenced.
During the comparison across DNA alignments for concatenation, the function will
consider that any species is represented by multiple sequences and so in each
individual gene dataset species will fully matched if they have exact scientific
name and associated identifying number.
