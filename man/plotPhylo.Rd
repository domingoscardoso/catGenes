\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylo object.}

\item{add_raxml_tree}{A RaxML-based phylo object.}

\item{add_parsi_tree}{A parsimony-based phylo object.}

\item{highlight_clade}{A vector of two tip labels to highlight their clade or
a list of multiple vectors with two tip labels each to highlight their clades.}

\item{fill_gradient}{Any color to highlight an specific clade in the tree.}

\item{highlight_taxa}{Define a vector with specific tip labels or the name of
any taxa (species or genus name) present in the tree to highlight them with
an specific color; defaults to "black".}

\item{highlight_color}{Color to highlight specific tip labels in the tree.}

\item{understate_taxa}{Define a vector with specific tip labels or the name of
any taxa (species or genus name) present in the tree to understate them with
a gray color. All other tips will be in black, unless you have set the
the arguments \code{highlight_taxa} \code{highlight_color} that define taxa
to be highlight with an specific color.}

\item{replace_taxa}{A vector of tip labels to be substituted with specific
alternative names. This is provided in the form of, for instance,
c("Harpalyce_formosa" = "Harpalyce_riparia",
"Harpalyce_cf_brasiliana" = "Harpalyce_magnibracteata"),
where the initial name represents the current tip label to be exchanged with
the corresponding alternative name.}

\item{prune_taxa}{A vector with specific tip labels to be dropped from the tree.}

\item{size_tiplab}{the size of tip labels; defaults to 2.}

\item{xlimtree}{Set x axis limits specially for tree panel.}

\item{gene_labels}{A title for the tree; usually a name of an specific gene
(or set of genes) from which the tree was reconstructed.}

\item{ylimgene}{Set y axis limits for gene labels.}

\item{phylogram_side}{if \code{TRUE}, a small phylogram with branch lengths
will be plotted on the upper left.}

\item{phylogram_supports}{if \code{TRUE}, the side phylogram will include the
same symbols of node support as those plotted in the main edited tree.}

\item{phylogram_height}{A number to adjust the size of the side phylogram.}

\item{save}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, the edited tree will be saved on disk.}

\item{dpi}{One number in the range of 72-4000 referring to the image
resolution in the format of dots per inch in the output file. Default is to
create an output with 600 dpi.}

\item{dir}{Pathway to the computer's directory, where the edited tree file will
be saved provided that the argument \code{save} is set up in \code{TRUE}. The
default is to create a directory named \strong{RESULTS_edited_tree} and the tree
will be saved within a subfolder named after the current date.}

\item{filename}{Name of the output file to be saved. The default is to
create a file entitled \strong{tree}.}

\item{format}{A character vector related to the file format of the global
map to be saved. The default is "jpg" to save the output in Joint
Photographic Experts Group (.jpg), but you can also choose "pdf" to save in
Portable Document Format (.pdf), "tiff" to save in Tag Image File Format
(.tiff) or "png" to save in Portable Network Graphics (.png).}
